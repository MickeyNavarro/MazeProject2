//This is Nasser Tadayon's Maze Project 1 code. The implementation of the LinkedList is my own code. The set up of the Table class & method names were also provided by Nasser. 

//This code was created via the https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler# for the language of C++ 17
    //this might be the reason for any unknown errors

/*Project: Maze 2 (Due at the end of Topic 2)
Replace the 2-dimensional array of objects in your Maze 1 program with linked lists of the same objects. The linked lists can be single, double, or circular as you deem appropriate for your implementation. Make as few changes as possible in the rest of the program. Write up what changes to Maze 1 would have reduced the number of such changes necessary. In retrospect, how would you have written Maze 1 differently?

/*
From Maze 1 to Maze 2, we had to change a very small amount of the previous code. If anything, I had to implement a new class with new methods. We really had to change any of the code that pertained to the array into code that pertained to the linked list/table. In retrospect, I still prefer the concept of an array. In my opinion, the array is easier to maintain. It also made it easier to navigate and easier to set/get the values. The use of the head was helpful in the linked list because it kept track of where one was located in the maze. However, only accessing the head added the need for more code. In short, I would prefer using an array to create this maze.
